Typography**Font Families**- Headings: 'Inter' (Google Fonts) - weight 700-900 for impact- Body: 'Inter' (Google Fonts) - weight 400-500 for readability- Code/Tech: 'JetBrains Mono' (Google Fonts) - weight 400-600 for tech stack displays**Scale**- Hero Title: text-6xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl (massive impact)- Section Headings: text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl- Subsection Headings: text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl- Card Titles: text-xl md:text-2xl- Body Text: text-base md:text-lg- Small Text: text-sm md:text-base**Treatments**- Use font-bold and font-black for headings- Letter-spacing: tracking-tight for large headings, tracking-normal for body- Line-height: leading-tight for headings, leading-relaxed for body text---### C. Layout System**Spacing Primitives**- Primary units: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32 (Tailwind units)- Section padding: py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-32- Card spacing: p-6 md:p-8 lg:p-10- Element gaps: gap-4 md:gap-6 lg:gap-8**Grid Systems**- Projects: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3- Skills: grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4- Timeline: Single column with side indicators**Containers**- Max width: max-w-7xl for most sections- Full width for hero: w-full with inner constraints- Reading width for text: max-w-3xl---### D. Component Library**Hero Section**- Full viewport height with background image (darkened, blurred)- Animated particle system with subtle movement- Large centered title with gradient text effect- Animated subtitle with typing or fade-in effect- Floating CTA buttons with hover lift animations- Custom cursor trail effects**Floating Project Cards**- Glassmorphic cards: backdrop-blur-md with dark background at 40% opacity- 3D tilt effect on hover using transform: rotateX/rotateY- Smooth scale animation (scale-105 on hover)- Subtle border glow on hover- Click expands to modal with project details- Filter pills at top with active state animations**Skills Visualization**- 3D icon cards with hover float (translateY)- Animated progress bars with scroll-trigger reveals- Tech stack badges with interactive tooltips- Icon bounce on first load and hover- Grid layout with stagger animation**Timeline Component**- Vertical line with animated fill on scroll- Timeline dots that pulse when in view- Cards slide in from alternating sides- Education/work experience with date indicators- Scroll-triggered animations using intersection observer**Glassmorphic Contact Form**- Floating appearance with backdrop-blur-xl- Input fields with focus glow effects- Animated submit button with ripple effect- Social icons in circular layout with orbital hover effects- Form validation with smooth error animations**Navigation**- Sticky header with backdrop-blur-md- Opacity changes on scroll (transparent to solid)- Mobile: Animated hamburger to full-screen menu- Navigation links with underline slide animation- Logo with subtle pulse animation**Custom Cursor**- Large circular cursor that follows mouse- Morphs on hover (grows for clickable elements)- Trail effect for movement- Changes color on interactive elements- Disabled on mobile/touch devices---### E. Animations & Transitions**Page Transitions**- Fade + slide combinations (duration-500)- Loading screen with geometric logo animation- Smooth scroll with snap-scroll: snap-y snap-mandatory**Scroll-Triggered Animations**- Fade up for cards and content blocks- Stagger animations for grids (delay-75, delay-150, delay-300)- Parallax on background image (slower scroll rate)- Timeline progress fills as user scrolls**Hover Effects**- Cards: transform scale-105 + translateY(-4px) + shadow-2xl- Buttons: scale-105 + glow effect + slight rotate- Images: scale-110 with overflow hidden- Icons: bounce or rotate-180 animations**Click/Tap Effects**- Ripple effect from click point- Scale down then up (scale-95 to scale-100)- Immediate visual feedback (duration-150)**Micro-interactions**- Input focus: border glow + scale-105- Button press: scale-95 then scale-100- Icon hover: rotate or bounce- Link hover: gradient text + underline slide---## Images**Background Image**- Location: Full-page fixed background- Treatment: Darkened (opacity-50 to opacity-80), parallax scroll effect- The provided futuristic 3D animated image should be used as base- Ensure high contrast with foreground content**No Additional Hero Image Required**- The animated background serves as the visual foundation- Focus on typography and 3D elements for hero impact---## Layout Specifications**Sections (in order)**1. Hero (100vh, centered content)2. About/Intro (scroll reveal)3. Projects (floating cards grid with filters)4. Skills (3D icon grid with animations)5. Experience Timeline (vertical layout)6. Contact (glassmorphic form)7. Footer (minimal, with social links)**Mobile Responsiveness**- Reduce 3D effects on mobile for performance- Stack all grids to single column- Simplify animations (duration-300 instead of complex sequences)- Touch-optimized interactions (larger tap targets)- Hamburger menu with slide-in animation---## Performance Considerations**Animation Strategy**- Use CSS transforms and opacity (GPU accelerated)- Lazy load 3D elements below fold- Reduce particle count on mobile- Use `will-change` sparingly and strategically- Implement intersection observer for scroll-triggered effects**Loading Strategy**- Critical CSS inline- Defer non-critical animations- Progressive enhancement for 3D effects- Show skeleton states during load
